- 👋 Hi, I’m @CharlieF67
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about how I might apply GitHub to my work in Higher Education.
- 👀 The idea of a version control system, where each iteration of your work is saved, merged, and built upon the last, is new to me.
- 🌱 I’m currently experimenting with developing a Twine game as part of a game-based learning course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications of GitHub to Higher Education.
- 📫 How to reach me at work: finchc@uhd.edu
